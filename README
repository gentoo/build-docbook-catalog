This is the source for app-text/build-docbook-catalog, which is a
script to regenerate the xml docbook catalog.

You can find it here:
	https://gitweb.gentoo.org/proj/build-docbook-catalog.git/

To make a release of this script, create a new git tag.
	git tag v2.0

We pull tarballs from the git site now.  So update the ebuild like normal.
